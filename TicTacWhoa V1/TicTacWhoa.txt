I was able to get everything working through multiple functions without any errors. Used different libraries for quality of life things such as system("clear");. I use a lot of addresses and pointers to store data for the settings and also the board data. This way I'd be able to work with it more easily through various functions without worrying about it. I used a lot of comments I believe in the code to describe the general processes without too  much confusion. I also had to use math for the winCon as I had to make sure that diagonals did not go from the right edge of the board to the left edge and vice versa.
