I believe that I finished the program 100% as all the functions are working
Compared to the first program this wasn't as hard other than debugging.
I pretty much had a structure that I used for both and only changing the equation in the structure. The structure consisted of a for loop to create a temp image array to make sure that the data doesn't influence future modifications to the pixels. I then made an if else statement where it checked border pixels and continued if it was as to ignore it. After that I had a for loop that summed the the surrounding pixel's values. The equation is then simplified accounting for the fact that the sum has the center pixel included. Afterwards, the value is ran through if statements to see if it goes below or beyond the range of unsigned char. Then finally assigned to the pixel at the end.
