I was able to easily transfer over the original functions as it was just getting over how to use pointers effectively and structs. Beyond that it was normal data manipulation that we have done before. For the new image modifications, it was a bit harder since I had to think on how to implement the new images with different sizes. Valgrind was super useful  as it was direct and told me what was leaking from where.
